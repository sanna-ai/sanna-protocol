# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sanna Protocol specification will be documented
in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Protocol versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Redaction Marker schema (Section 2.11): marker structure, `original_hash`
  computation, pre-existing marker injection guard, file naming convention,
  hash recomputation rules
- Authority Name Normalization algorithm (Appendix D): NFKC + camelCase
  splitting + separator normalization + casefold + dot-join, with 16 test
  vectors
- HMAC token binding corrections (Section 8.2): `esc_` prefix on escalation
  IDs, Python-default separators for `args_digest`

### Changed
- Canonical JSON cross-language guidance: Go HTML-escaping warning, float
  rejection clarified for Go/Rust number parsing
- Base64 pinned to RFC 4648 standard with padding (Section 5.1)
- Exit code accumulation rule: highest-priority code wins (Section 9.2)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- 28 precision fixes from cross-platform security review
- Key ID computation from raw Ed25519 bytes (not DER)
- NFC normalization documentation
- Float rejection in signing contexts
- Threat model (Section 12.3)
- Schemas for `authority_decisions`, `escalation_events`,
  `source_trust_evaluations`, `identity_verification`
- Key file encoding specification (PKCS#8 PEM / SubjectPublicKeyInfo PEM)
- `correlation_id` pipe character constraint

### Changed
- `hash_text` default truncation corrected to 64 characters
- Status computation handles all severity levels
- Receipt Triad hashing made byte-precise
- `checks_hash` ordering and null key rules clarified

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Initial specification release
- Receipt format with 12-field fingerprint construction
- Constitution format (YAML) with boundaries, invariants, halt conditions
- Sanna Canonical JSON (RFC 8785 derived, NFC normalized)
- Ed25519 signing for receipts and constitutions
- Verification protocol with exit codes
- Evidence bundle format
- Escalation and approval chain with HMAC-SHA256 token binding
- Receipt Triad (input_hash, reasoning_hash, action_hash)
- JSON Schema (2020-12) for receipts and constitutions
- Golden test fixtures for cross-language conformance
- Constitution templates (privacy-focused, developer, locked-down)
- HTTP header conventions for REST API receipt transport

### Field Renames (from pre-1.0)
